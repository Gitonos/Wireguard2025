LICENSE.txt

This document outlines the terms and conditions governing the use, distribution, and non-liability pertaining to the "WireGuard Profile Generator" software application (hereinafter referred to as "the Application"). This Application is a specialized, internally developed tool designed for a specific production suit and is not, in any manner, an official product, effort, or endorsement of the WireGuard project or its developers.

1. Preamble and Intent

The Application is engineered with the paramount intent of enhancing defensive measures for network configurations. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the secure and accurate generation of WireGuard client profiles, including TOML forecasted settings for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. It is exclusively intended for the self-use case of the WireGuard client by its individual operator. The design philosophy behind this Application prioritizes ease of auto-setup, aiming to mitigate human error, specifically preventing incorrect punctuation or typing incidences that could compromise profile functionality. By ensuring accurate configurations, the Application contributes to stopping unwanted malicious network attacks that a properly configured VPN is designed to prevent. This tool is meticulously designed for internal protection, operating outside public IP firewall segments, and is emphatically not intended, nor does it possess the capability, to operate with surveillance on privacy IP addresses or to collect user-specific data such as PC names or mobile client identifiers. It serves solely as an aiding program for automated configuration procedures.

2. Absolute Disclaimer of Liability and Non-Accountability

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE CREATOR, DEVELOPERS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY AFFILIATED ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PROVISION, OR MAINTENANCE OF THE APPLICATION BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS APPLICATION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

No Malicious Intent or Abuse: The Application shall not be distributed, shared, or discussed on dark web platforms, public forums, or any other medium with the intent of facilitating abuse, malicious modifications, or to lure, conspire, or trigger liability damage against individuals or entities through the creation of WireGuard profiles. Its use for any illicit, unethical, or harmful activity is strictly forbidden.

c.  No Surveillance or Data Collection: This Application is not a tool for surveillance. It is expressly prohibited to modify, adapt, or use the Application in any way that enables the collection of insecure typing figures, user data, network activity logs, or any form of privacy-invasive information. It is designed to protect, not to monitor.

d.  No Network Bridging or Vulnerability Introduction: The Application's core function is to enhance security. Any attempt to modify a user's effort to bridge network gaps, intentionally open networks to attack, or introduce vulnerabilities is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of these terms.

e.  No Malicious Reporting or Generator Process Interference: Users are prohibited from maliciously reporting the generator processes, interfering with the Application's intended functionality, or attempting to exploit its design for any purpose other than its stated defensive use.

4. Permitted Use and Scope

The Application is designed for the following specific and limited uses:

a.  Defense Priority: Its primary and overriding purpose is a defense matter of priority, providing secure VPN settings and TOML forecasted setting configurations for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

b.  WireGuard Client Self-Use: It is intended exclusively for the self-use case of the WireGuard client by the end-user for their personal, internal network security needs.

c.  Automated Configuration Aid: The Application's function is to simplify and automate the setup procedure for WireGuard profiles, aiding in the creation of more secure configurations.

d.  Punctuation and Typing Accuracy: It is designed to assist in filling out configuration details within the app to complete a "zero wrong punctuation typing incidence," ensuring profiles work as intended and preventing common configuration errors that could lead to vulnerabilities.

e.  Internal Protection: The Application is specially designed to provide internal protection outside public IP firewall segments.

f.  Regulated Settings: The Application applies settings regulated according to basic knowledge of network security and WireGuard operation. It does not provide easily modifiable settings that could inadvertently weaken security.

5. No Warranties and "AS IS" Provision

The Application is provided "as is," without any express or implied warranties whatsoever, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
